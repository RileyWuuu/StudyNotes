## Course Intro:
### 1. Abstract data types
  - What interface does this abstract data type has?
### 2. Implementation
  - Which data structure can we use?
  - What kind of algorithm can we use on this data structure?
### 3. Cost of memory and time
  - time complexity
  - space complexity

## Abstract Data Types
* Mathematical / Logical model
* Theoretical concept
