1. Data structure that contains a fixed numbers of elements that all have the same type.

## Extending a array
1. There's no way to extend an array buy simply adding a block behind the current array. Cuz you don't know whether the program is using other spaces for somethine else.

- First we initialize our array, it would be a perfect fit bewteen other spaces.
